Ever find yourself having to write a quick bash script to run, yet another, *new* tool against a long list of targets in an engagement? Of course you have. All the time..
Well, no more!
Now, you can just sit back and have yourself a Guinness!

Guinness is a *very* simple tool wrapper script for the endless number of simple scanners, PoC scripts, new attack tools, etc. that you have to deal with on a daily basis. Simply drop all your targets in an empty text file, one per line, add then enter the first part of the command into the interface when Guinness asks you for it, then enter the rest of the command after the target paramter when Guinness asks you for that. Dead simple.

Genius? Nope, Guinness. :)
